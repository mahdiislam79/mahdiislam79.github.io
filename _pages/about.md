Hi! I’m Mahdi Islam, a researcher specializing in Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Biomedical Image Processing. **I’m currently in my third semester of an Erasmus Mundus Joint Master’s degree in Medical Imaging and Applications (MAIA) and actively seeking funded internship opportunities for my master’s thesis in the fourth semester.** My aim is to contribute to groundbreaking research in medical imaging and AI, driving innovation in healthcare.

### Areas of Expertise
- **Medical Image Segmentation**: 
  - Segmentation of various organs and tissues (e.g., brain, colorectal tissue).
- **Deep Learning**: 
  - Vision language models (VLMs).
  - Convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
  - Large language models (LLMs).
  - Retrieval augmented generation (RAG).
- **Medical Image Processing and Analysis**: 
  - Colorectal cancer classification.
  - Gait anomaly detection.
  
### Research Interests
I am deeply interested in applying deep learning and large language models (LLMs) to the following fields:
  - **Neuroimaging**: Enhancing brain imaging analysis with advanced AI techniques.
  - **Neuroscience**: Leveraging AI to understand and map neural processes.
  - **Cardiovascular Imaging**: Improving diagnostics in cardiovascular health using deep learning.
  - **Stroke Analysis**: Developing AI-driven methods for early detection and treatment of stroke.
  - **Cancer and Histopathology**: Utilizing machine learning to better classify and segment cancerous tissues.

### Professional Background
- **Lecturer, Metropolitan University**: Prior to my master’s program, I was a lecturer, where I honed my expertise in teaching core topics of Computer Science and Engineering domain.
- **Bachelor’s Degree**: Graduated from the Islamic University of Technology with a focus on machine learning in medical imaging.

I’m passionate about integrating AI into healthcare, fostering innovation, and making a tangible impact in the medical field.
