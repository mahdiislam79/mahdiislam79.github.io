Hi! I’m **Mahdi Islam**, a researcher specializing in **Deep Learning**, **Computer Vision**, and **Biomedical Image Processing**. **I’m currently in my third semester of the Erasmus Mundus Joint Master’s program in Medical Imaging and Applications (MAIA)** and preparing for my master’s thesis at the Medical University of Innsbruck, Austria, focusing on AI-driven advancements in cardiovascular imaging. I am actively seeking **funded PhD opportunities for Fall 2025** to continue contributing to impactful research in AI-driven healthcare innovations.

## Areas of Expertise
- **Medical Image Segmentation**:
  - Brain tissue segmentation (Grey Matter, White Matter, CSF).
  - Colorectal tissue and gland segmentation.
- **Deep Learning**:
  - Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Foundation Models.
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
  - Semi/Weakly Supervised Segmentation.
- **Medical Image Processing and Analysis**:
  - Cancer detection and histopathology analysis.
  - Gait anomaly detection with real-time predictive models.

## Research Interests
I’m passionate about leveraging **deep learning and vision-language models** to transform medical imaging and diagnostics, with a focus on:
- **Neuroimaging**: AI-enhanced analysis for brain mapping.
- **Cardiovascular Imaging**: Echocardiogram-based diagnostics.
- **Stroke Analysis**: AI-driven methods for early stroke detection.
- **Cancer and Histopathology**: Machine learning pipelines for tissue classification and segmentation.
- **Image Reconstruction & Synthesis**: For accurate diagnosis and prognosis.

## Professional Background
- **Visiting Research Student (Upcoming)**:  
  - *Medical University of Innsbruck, Austria* (Master’s Thesis, 2025).  
  - Research focus: Few-shot video-based vision-language models.
