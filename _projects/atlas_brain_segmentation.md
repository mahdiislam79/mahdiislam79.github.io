title: "Atlas and Tissue-Model Guided Gaussian Mixture Models for Brain Tissue Segmentation"
description: "Implemented a comprehensive brain tissue segmentation pipeline for MRI images, combining Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) with atlas-based and tissue probability models. The method integrates spatial and intensity information to segment brain tissues into Grey Matter (GM), White Matter (WM), and Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF). Segmentation accuracy was evaluated using Dice similarity scores, highlighting the benefits of combining spatial and intensity-based approaches."
