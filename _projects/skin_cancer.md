title: "Skin Cancer Classification: Machine Learning vs Deep Learning Techniques"
description: "Developed a Computer-Aided Diagnostic (CAD) system for skin lesion classification using advanced preprocessing techniques and feature extraction. Implemented traditional machine learning models for binary and multiclass classification of skin lesions, distinguishing between benign and malignant cases. Future work includes exploring deep learning approaches for improved accuracy."
